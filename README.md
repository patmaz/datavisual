# Data Visualisation - from JSON file to graphs

The following technologies were used:

* jquery - a basic framework required by jqplot...
* jqplot - a plotting and charting plugin - quite efficient/flexible and relatively easy in use
* json data strucutre
* AJAX call to load a json file
* some native js code for calculations and transformations of provided data which feeds jqplot

more comments mainly in custom.js file
!!! must be tested on a server !!!
