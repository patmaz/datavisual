# Data Visualisation

BRANCH IN PROGRESS

read data from single JSON array

The following technologies were used:

* jquery - a basic framework required by jqplot...
* jqplot - a plotting and charting plugin - quite efficient/flexible and relatively easy in use
* some native js code for calculations on provided data

more comments mainly in custom.js file
